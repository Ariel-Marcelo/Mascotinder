# Mascotinder
Our web application functions like Tinder but for pets. It aims to help pet owners find suitable matches for their beloved companions. Our primary goal is to make a lasting impact and appeal to a wide audience, even those without pets.

Our application allows users to create detailed profiles for their pets, showcasing their unique and attractive qualities. Users can search and connect with other pet owners whose pets share similar interests, whether it's breed, age, or personality. Additionally, our integrated chat feature facilitates communication between users, making it easy to organize playdates or simply share experiences and stories about their pets.

To enhance the overall experience, we have incorporated a location-sharing feature that enables users to discover nearby pet-focused stores, ensuring their pets receive the best care and access to top-quality accessories.

Our application is targeted at all pet owners who want to find suitable partners for their pets while building connections and friendships with fellow animal lovers. We aim to provide a fun and secure platform where pet owners can interact and enjoy the company of like-minded individuals.

For the development of this project, we have chosen to utilize Spring Boot as our backend framework and Thymeleaf for the frontend, enabling us to create a dynamic and easily maintainable web application. We are excited to work on this project and are committed to delivering a high-quality experience for all pet enthusiasts.
